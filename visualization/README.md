# Visualization

## Goals
- To view features plotted against performance metrics to see if the 'look' useful.
- To view features plotted against price data to see if they 'look' correct.

### Implementation Thoughts
Data is going to be generated by spark runs.

We'll need an api we can hit that can return data dynamically.

Initially we'll probably want something simple like 'get last run data' or something.

Later we might want some kind of data storage/reference scheme where we can easily choose what feature/dataset we want to view.

Eventually we'd like to be able to just ask for whatever data we want, and either get an appropriate cached version back, or have that call trigger a spark run to generate the data and return it.
